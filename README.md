# XD-build GitHub Pages

This repository contains the source for the [XD-build

The website is powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and the
source is transformed into actual website (HTML) by
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

## Contributing

Contributions to the XD-build GitHub Pages are more than welcome.  Just fork
this repository and send a pull request with your changes.

Before sending the pull request, please test your changes!

To do this, you need to [install
Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), and run 'make'.  The
resulting HTML files are placed in the _site/ folder, so fire up your browser
on that and verify that the result is as expected.
